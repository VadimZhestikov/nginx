# COMCON — Roadmap & Measured Results (v3)

*Merges v2 §8 (staging) and §11 (first slice) with the typed-policy→maxim milestone
plan and the M1 gate results. Ordering is de-risked: validate the payoff before
building the compiler; two hard gates (M1 performance, M8 safety) plus the hardening
gate (M-SES) before any untrusted execution.*

---

## 1. Positioning

- **COMCON is step 1.** Policies double as **compilation contracts**: a fragment whose
  environment (imports), exports, and internals are fully described is closed enough
  for AOT.
- **maxim** (QuickJS fork; JS→C via bytecode→C→GCC/TCC, typed vars, phase-35
  server-AOT, phase-34 hybrid `.so` = C fn + bytecode fallback) is **step 2**,
  consuming policy-annotated typed fragments.
- **mirror as a policy:** the mirror transpiler is a compile-time transformation — an
  *adaptive-profile* policy in v3 terms.

The pipeline: typed COMCON policy (.js, restricted+typed) → parse restricted subset →
capability check (compile-time reject) → type-bind against the typed host-API schema →
maxim lowering to unboxed C against typed nginx stubs → per-tenant `.so` (hybrid
fallback) → the event dispatcher calls the C function pointer directly.

## 2. Milestones

- **M1 — Perf spike (hand-written C, no compiler). ✅ GATE PASSED 2026-08-16.**
  Hand-wrote the C a compiled "count + tag" policy would become (shm-atomic counter +
  request-header read + two response headers + body) as a static nginx module;
  benchmarked against the *same policy* as an interpreted mirror rule on an identical
  config skeleton. Results (h2load, HTTP/1.1 keepalive, best of 3):

  | Config | loopback | % | cross-host 10GbE | % |
  |---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
  | stock nginx (no policy) | 391,233 | 100% | 424,882 | 100% |
  | **hand-C policy** | 350,165 | **90%** | 409,386 | **96%** |
  | interpreted mirror | 113,327 | 29% | 119,044 | 28% |

  Hand-C = **3.1–3.4×** the interpreted mirror. A *reduced-policy control* (the
  directive-expressible subset run additionally as pure nginx `map`+`add_header`
  config) showed directives ≈ hand-C ≈ stock — **the whole gap is the interpreter**,
  and the compiler's payoff is precisely the policies directives cannot express
  (shared state, counters, routing). Artifacts: `t_performance/maxim_m1/` (branch
  `js_comcon`). These are the measured endpoints of the performance gradient
  (FOUNDATION §8); v2's cost model (§8.2) is no longer only argued.

- **M2 — Typed nginx-API schema.** Machine-readable static type signatures for the
  policy-visible host surface (mirror `ev.*` first: header/cookie reads, response-header
  writes, table get/set/incr, respond/selectUpstream), each op carrying param/return
  types, required capability, effect class, and C-stub signature. **Fuse with
  hardening S4** — the same walk over the `describe()` registry yields the type row
  and the facet/reach rule per op (HARDENING §S4).

- **M2.5 — POM + kernel spec.** Consolidate `SEMANTICS.md` + `POM.md` into the
  normative spec: resources, the four operators, possession metatheorem,
  closure/quotation, profiles, node interface, R/L/F/X classes. After M2.5, M3's
  capability check is simply "does this reference resolve in the bound environment."

- **M-SES — engine hardening.** Phases S1–S6 and the gate as specified in
  `HARDENING.md`. Does not block M2–M5 (trusted code); **gates M6/M7-with-tenants**;
  required even pure-AOT (hybrid fallback re-enters the interpreter). Start S1 early.

- **M3 — COMCON front-end.** Restricted-subset parser + capability declarations +
  compile-time rejection of out-of-environment references. Typed AST out, no codegen.

- **M4 — Type binding.** Bind the AST against the M2 schema → fully-typed IR; `any`
  forced to the hybrid path. Typed locals inferred; mismatches rejected.

- **M5 — maxim lowering (one handler).** Lower typed request-header handlers to
  unboxed C against the typed stubs (the M1 hand-written ABI). Deliverable: a
  compiler-produced `.so` for the M1 example; behavior byte-identical to the
  interpreted rule; the C ideally ≈ M1's hand-written C.

- **M6 — Dispatch + AOT wiring.** The event dispatcher calls the compiled C function
  pointer (per-tenant `.so`, phase-35 precompile); interpreted fallback for the
  non-lowerable. End-to-end compiled policy serving in a worker. *Gated by M-SES.*
  The POM's class-F live-rewrite machinery (epoch broadcast + dirty→fallback→re-AOT)
  lands here, reusing `describe()` and the cfgbus transport.

- **M7 — Benchmark the real pipeline.** Compiled-by-COMCON policy vs interpreted vs
  stock, same method as M1. The number that confirms (or corrects) M1 at
  full-pipeline scale — expected between M1's 28% and 96% endpoints, near the top if
  the lowering is direct.

- **M8 — Safety hardening + audit. GATE for any multitenant use.** The compiler-
  faithfulness obligation, now precise (SEMANTICS §3 assumption F): *the lowered C
  must refine the mediated semantics along the provenance links — simulating every
  MEDIATE/NAME gate it erased.* Plus per-tenant `.so` isolation, table-key
  namespacing, worker resource guards, threat-model doc.

- **M9 — Breadth.** More events (response headers, L4/TLS), the borrowed/owned string
  ABI to kill refcount churn, the `any` hybrid, wider typed surface. Iterative.
  **Post-M9 track:** information-flow/taint labels (confidentiality axis —
  FOUNDATION §13.4).

**Critical path:** M1 ✅ → M2(+S4) → M2.5 → M3 → M4 → M5 → [M-SES gate] → M6 → M7 →
M8 gate → M9.

## 3. Delivery staging (v2 §8.1, preserved)

The three-stage delivery order stands, now with its guarantee proved rather than
argued (soundness is stage-independent — SEMANTICS §3):

1. **Stage 1 — declarative only.** Policy code executes only inside compilation
   episodes; runtime = engine consults static residue. Covers the multi-tenant core
   and is exactly the maxim-compilable profile. Stage-1 reservations (tri-state
   descriptors, check-point placement, function-tolerant field shapes) remain
   mandatory so stages 2–3 arrive without migration.
2. **Stage 2 — compile-time transforms.** Parser callbacks and source/AST rewrites —
   mirror-as-policy (adaptive profile) lands here.
3. **Stage 3 — runtime interceptors.** The resident residue: value validators, dynamic
   predicates — `mediate` interceptors on the hot path, tri-state keeping allow/deny
   fast.

---

## 4. Minimal first slice (v3 revision of v2 §11)

Exercises every pillar, updated for the kernel and the anchors model:

1. **Anchor recognition** — `"use comcon: <name>";` directive-prologue anchors parsed
   and exposed as node attributes (inert in plain JS).
2. **Minimal kernel** — `env()/grant/bind` for one enumerated node kind; a policy
   program runs at stage 0 under a hardcoded root environment.
3. **One static enforcement** — a free identifier not in the bound environment is a
   compile error; an excluded production (`WhileStatement`) rejected via `admit`'s
   syntactic predicate.
4. **One runtime enforcement** — a single mediated capability (prefix-guarded `fetch`
   or an opaque value) enforced at a check point.
5. **Monotonic nesting test** — an inner `bind` can tighten but not loosen (2)–(4);
   plus the two negative tests from the worked examples: granting a withheld name
   fails statically; splicing a capability into a quotation fails at construction.
6. **Escape-probe seed** — the first five S6 probes (constructor ladder, prototype
   pollution, indirect eval, `.stack` leak, COM upward traversal) running against the
   slice.
7. **Microbenchmarks** — shared-property access, cross-fragment call, mediated-op
   dispatch vs stock qjs; the COW/IC/revocation cost question (FOUNDATION §13.1) is
   the make-or-break implementation risk and must be measured, not argued.

> Validates: anchors + external binding, policy-as-program over the real kernel,
> static + runtime enforcement, the narrowing lattice, the cap-free-quotation rule,
> and the first hardening probes — a stage-1 artifact honoring the stage-1
> reservations.
